### 1. Application binary interface
#### 1.1 Implementation hiding
Language supports usage of binary code with headers - the implementation of a service and/or category not revealed in this case. The user has access to information about accepted inputs, locations imported from, data stored at exported locations, and respective restraints on import and export locations for services.

For category definitions, category body in implementation file must be an instance of category body in header, so user has access to output structure, with some information about specific category structures redacted, if needed.

#### 1.2 Linking
Binaries generated by compilers must be tagged with a unique compiler identifier - this ensures that only compatible binaries may be linked unless explicitly requested by developer.
